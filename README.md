ZeroFrame is a **PHP framework** for web application and set of reusable PHP Native component based on **Symfony framework**.

Based on Symfony ? Why we used your Framework instead of Symfony
------------

  Symfony is a incredible framework but some companies dont like to use framework and want to make their own framework.
  Their company say the same thing: It's a  Symfony Like. Imagine the dev time for just make a lite symfony.
  So I take the decision to create a PHP framework with a MVC structure for just make a website, a API RESTful in PHP native without template engine, ORM engine or DBAL.
  Allowing to choose these own libriries and to be sure to use a lite PHP native framework.
